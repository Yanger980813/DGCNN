# DGCNN
pytorch implementation of EEG Emotion Recognition Using Dynamical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

Step 1: Download the SEED dataset, locate the ExtractFeatures folder, create the session1, session2, and session3 folders, and divide the original dataset into sessions

Step 2: Use extract_DE.m Extract DE features from ExtractFeatures folder

Step 3: Use main_DE_subject_independent.py The calculation result of the subject-independent file, but the path needs to be modified in advance
