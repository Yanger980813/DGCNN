# DGCNN
pytorch implementation of EEG Emotion Recognition Using Dynamical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

Step 1: Download the SEED dataset, use partition.py to divide the original dataset into sessions

Step 2: Use extract_DE.py extract DE features from ExtractFeatures folder

Step 3: Run file main_DE_subject_independent.py to calculate subject-independent result, but the load path needs to be modified in advance
